How Fast Does Your PC Boot? - Ubuntu, Revisited
================

### The [Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase) [advertisement](https://vimeo.com/14989758) recreated with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG by Goce Mitevski

Please view this presentation in the most recent stable version of Mozilla Firefox. Other modern browsers *do not currently fully support SVG Filter Effects animations*, so you probably won't see the Ubuntu symbol moving at all.

If [you have an issue you'd like to report](https://github.com/gocemitevski/ubuntu-advertisement/issues), please do that here on GitHub.
